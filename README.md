# snake
A snake game using MIPS 
This application uses a 512 x 512 layout with a width and height of 8 pixels. 
To control the snake you must use the keys J, K, L and I. 
These keys represent Left, Down, Right and Up respectively. 
The game ends when the snake runs into itself or into a wall. 

There is no end game result because I do not anticipate anyone being able to complete the game.
